# List of one or more consistency checks to run on a periodic basis
# (if "frequency" is set) or every time borgmatic runs checks (if
# "frequency" is omitted).
# checks:
# Name of the consistency check to run:
#  * "repository" checks the consistency of the
# repository.
#  * "archives" checks all of the archives.
#  * "data" verifies the integrity of the data
# within the archives and implies the "archives"
# check as well.
#  * "spot" checks that some percentage of source
# files are found in the most recent archive (with
# identical contents).
#  * "extract" does an extraction dry-run of the
# most recent archive.
#  * See "skip_actions" for disabling checks
# altogether.
# - name: spot

# How frequently to run this type of consistency
# check (as a best effort). The value is a number
# followed by a unit of time. E.g., "2 weeks" to
# run this consistency check no more than every
# two weeks for a given repository or "1 month" to
# run it no more than monthly. Defaults to
# "always": running this check every time checks
# are run.
# frequency: 2 weeks

# After the "frequency" duration has elapsed, only
# run this check if the current day of the week
# matches one of these values (the name of a day of
# the week in the current locale). "weekday" and
# "weekend" are also accepted. Defaults to running
# the check on any day of the week.
# only_run_on:
# - Saturday
# - Sunday

# The percentage delta between the source
# directories file count and the most recent backup
# archive file count that is allowed before the
# entire consistency check fails. This can catch
# problems like incorrect excludes, inadvertent
# deletes, etc. Required (and only valid) for the
# "spot" check.
# count_tolerance_percentage: 10

# The percentage of total files in the source
# directories to randomly sample and compare to
# their corresponding files in the most recent
# backup archive. Required (and only valid) for the
# "spot" check.
# data_sample_percentage: 1

# The percentage of total files in the source
# directories that can fail a spot check comparison
# without failing the entire consistency check. This
# can catch problems like source files that have
# been bulk-changed by malware, backups that have
# been tampered with, etc. The value must be lower
# than or equal to the "contents_sample_percentage".
# Required (and only valid) for the "spot" check.
# data_tolerance_percentage: 0.5

# Command to use instead of "xxh64sum" to hash
# source files, usually found in an OS package named
# "xxhash". Do not substitute with a different hash

# succeed. Only valid for the "spot" check.
# xxh64sum_command: /usr/local/bin/xxh64sum

# How many seconds to check the repository before
# interrupting the check. Useful for splitting a
# long-running repository check into multiple
# partial checks. Defaults to no interruption. Only
# applies to the "repository" check, does not check
# the repository index, and is not compatible with a
# simultaneous "archives" check or "--repair" flag.
# max_duration: 3600

# Paths or labels for a subset of the configured "repositories" (see
# above) on which to run consistency checks. Handy in case some of
# your repositories are very large, and so running consistency checks
# on them would take too long. Defaults to running consistency checks
# on all configured repositories.

# - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg

# Restrict the number of checked archives to the last n. Applies only
